1. Pipes are half-duplex
2. Pipes are not synonymous with shared memory
   Used for solving producer-consumer algorithms

3. Basic hand-shake between writer and reader
   a. Writer blocks if pipe buffer is full until the reader consumes data
   b. Reader blocks if pipe buffer is empty until writer produces data

   c. Reader exits (read() returns 0) if there are no more writers on the pipe
   d. Writer is killed with SIGPIPE if there are no readers on the pipe
