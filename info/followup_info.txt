- sem close() from forked processes and in parent
- munmap() 	in all forked processes
- close() in forker processes
- singal hanlders in children
	If you do fork (without further exec*) after a signal handler has been registered, the
	same signal handler will be used in parent and child processes.

- signals and thread
	The signal disposition is a per-process attribute: in a multithreaded application, the
	disposition of a particular signal is the same for all threads.


- What happens if main thread exits?
	- Boom, all threads go down.
	- So wait for threads to finish (pthread_join)
